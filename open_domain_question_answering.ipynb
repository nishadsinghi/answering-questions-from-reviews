I love the new music menu features on the Zune HD. First off, the artist menu is amazing. It starts off with the artists picture in the background and it has the basic albums and songs side menues, then theres artists pictures, which you can use as your background by the way, it also has a full bio of the artist on another side menu which is awesome, who wouldn't love to get a background of the artist. With the new firmware update now also there is underlined part in the bio which allows you to click on them, which is normally artists or other albums, and you can use the devices wi-fi directly from the bio and go to the artist or other album and download it with the on-device marketplace. Whats also included is related artists, which has a picture list of all the related artists which you can click on to either access their artist menu, or go to the on-device marketplace and download their stuff. What I think is the best is the screensaver mode when you are listening to songs. It really takes advantage of the screen. It starts after around 15 seconds on not touching the screen. The artist picture is in the background and the information from the screen is scrolling around the screen in all different directions, if you have used the Zune software, you might have seen this feature. Its just the icing on the cake. Microsoft really did try to get the music exploration aspect in Zune and they did a very good job.Videos: Simple enough...with the screen all the videos look beautiful. You can either choose since the device is widescreen to either keep the video at its full screen and have black sides or zoom in and make the video full screen. I love that you have the choice to do that. Colors really show up on this device so if you plan to watch an animated tv show like Family Guy, you can actually tell what color the wall in the background is.Zune Pass: Genius...$15 a month for unlimited streaming of songs and you get to keep 10 of those songs each month.

Their best attribute is that they are cheap. The sound from them is nothing special. In comparison to my standard white IPod buds these seem to emphasize the higher frequencies. There seems to be nothing happening in the bass range with these. I don't think they are efficient enough to have much bass at all. To be fair, my IPod buds overly emphasize bass so they are not that accurate either. I also compared these to a pricy Sennheiser set that I've owned for a couple of years and let's just say there is a reason why the Sennheisers cost more.Surely these Panasonic buds are very nice to use if you think they might get damaged somehow in use as it will not break your heart to have to replace them. These might be especially useful if you only listen to talk radio or have high frequency hearing loss. If you really like to listen to the most of your music and you must wear earbuds then these are not for you.I also have to note that these are packaged in a difficult to open blister pack that required several passes with utility shears to break into. I hate to see all the plastic that has to be discarded just to get this product out of the package.Cosmetically, they are OK. They don't hurt my ears and are comfortable to me. They come with a couple of other size ear pieces if you are hard to fit. The wires take a set when folded so they are not very well-behaved and don't coil nicely and lie flat when you put them away.

That being said, I love this mouse.I have a skinny hands with long fingers.  This mouse fits me perfectly.  There's a slight learning curve for the thumb buttons.  However, I was hitting them perfectly within the first hour.  The contour of the index finger buttons makes them especially familiar immediately.  I have always preferred the contour of a Logitech mouse so none of this surprises me.In terms of tracking it works great, as it should.  I use a Razer Exactmat speed surface so I predicted and received flawless tracking.  Unfortunately I haven't tested this on any other surface so I can't comment.Others feel the battery life is poor.  It seems to last three hours while gaming.  I couldn't care less.  Leaving the cord plugged into a USB port and sitting on the desk is simple.  I've always had a corded mouse so it doesn't upset me to play while it charges.Weight has been a posted concern.  I tested the mouse at the local electronics shop first and liked it.  I tended to prefer maxing the weight on my old G5.Finally I couldn't help but comment on a faulty review posted below.  The scroll wheel toggles to allow both free spinning and locking via a simple button smack dab in the middle of the mouse.  Great for switching weapons or zipping through PDFs.All in all this may have been a frivolous purchase as my old G5 was running like a champ.  Still I'm very pleased. The features are fantastic.  Setpoint works like a champ for profiling.  With all the extra buttons this mouse easily bests the G5 for any RPG.Update:  6 months later and I still enjoy the form and function of this mouse.  Changing jobs I've discovered yet another application for it.  With a [...] I take this into work everyday and really enjoy all the extra buttons for macro functions.  I've opted to stay corded at work so that I don't forget to bring the receiver home again.  With this beast and a few macros I've drastically cut my keystrokes for productivity applications.

The case detaches from the keyboard, and it allows you to use the iPad by itself. All ports are exposed and are easily accessible with cords.The keyboard paired up with my iPad Air very easily and without any hitches. It also maintained connection for the duration of use.
